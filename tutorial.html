	<p class="tutorial">This tutorial is designed to guide students and faculty through printing through Penn State's Maker Commons using MakerBot Replicator 5 printers. If you are not a member of Penn State but have your own 3D printer, many parts of this tutorial may not apply to you, but stl files of all viruses are provided for your use! </p>
    <h2>What is 3D Printing?</h2>
    <p class="tutorial">3D Printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a method of creating three dimensional objects by depositing thin layers of material until a 3D part is formed.  If you want to learn more about the technical aspects of 3D printing, consider going <a href="https://3dprinting.com/what-is-3d-printing/">here</a> or joining the Penn State 3D printing club <a href="http://sites.psu.edu/3dprintingclub/">here</a>!</p>

    <h2>I. Choosing Your Print</h2>
    <ol class="tutorial">
      <li class="tutorial">To select your print, navigate to the main page of the website and select the model you would like to download. </li>
      <li class="tutorial">Once on the individual virus page, select the .makerbot download to download your file.</li>
      <ul class="tutorial">
        <li class="tutorial">If the model you are downloading is an assembly, you may receive a zipped folder. Simply right click this folder once downloaded and select “Extract All” to receive your files.</li>
        <li class="tutorial">Once your file has downloaded, you will likely be notified that it cannot be opened. This is fine, as the file only needs to be reuploaded to another site and not opened on your computer.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    </div>
	  <p class="tutorial"> <span style="font-weight: 900;">NOTE:</span> When choosing your model, you may want to think about how easy the model is to print and finalize.  Models with small nooks and crannies, or large amounts of overhangs and small pieces will likely include a large amount of support material that may be difficult to reach or remove. Complex models may take an hour or more to remove supports without breaking the model itself. If this is your first time 3D printing, it is advisable to choose a model has a rather smooth and simple shape, such as a spherical model (ex. PhiX174), as these will likely have less frustrating support materials to work with. If you would like a better sense of what your final model will look like, and predict where supports may appear, download and open the .stl file located next to the .makerbot file of your print to view the base 3D model. See more about removing support in the "Finalizing Your Print" section of this guide.</p>

    <h2>II. Uploading Your Print</h2>
    <ol class="tutorial">
      <li class="tutorial">Navigate to the Penn State’s Maker Commons submission site at <a href="https://makercommons.psu.edu/3dsubmit/">https://makercommons.psu.edu/3dsubmit/</a> and select whether your print is personal or for a class. </li>
      <li class="tutorial">Next you will be prompted to upload your .makerbot file to the checkup tool to verify that it will print. If any of the categories come back as <span style="color:red">FAIL</span> please contact your instructor or email <a href="mailto:jxk5760@psu.edu">jxk5760@psu.edu</a>. </li>
      <li class="tutorial">Fill out the submission form and submit, then follow the link to Penn State’s MakerBot Innovation Center or click <a href="https://psu.innovationcenter.makerbot.com/">here</a>.</li>
      <li class="tutorial">Make an account using your Penn State email, or sign into an existing one.</li>
      <li class="tutorial"> Once signed in, navigate to “New Print” on the left-hand side and enter the name of your project. Do not select a deadline, as it is unable to be enforced.</li>
      <li class="tutorial">Under “Filament Information” select “PLA”, then select the color you would like your print to be. This option may not be available during busy times of the semester, and you may have to select "Any Color" </li>
      <li class="tutorial">Ensure that you have the “Upload Files” checkbox selected, then upload the same .makerbot file here that you had uploaded to the checkup tool. Keep in mind that although multiple filetypes are listed as acceptable, only .makerbot files that passed the checkup tool will be approved for printing.</li>
      <li class="tutorial">If you are at any Penn State campus other than University Park, enter your campus in the notes section at the bottom to have the print shipped to your campus’ library. If you are a World Campus student, provide your shipping address in the notes section of the submission.</li>
      <li class="tutorial">Once you have completed these steps, hit next then confirm your print. If you need multiple models, or have multiple parts to a print, you must resubmit each file individually to the innovation center, as single requests with multiple models may not be honored.</li>

    <h2>III. Picking Up Your Print</h2>
    <ol class="tutorial">
      <li class="tutorial">Once your submitted prints have been approved by the maker commons, you will receive an email indicating so.</li>
      <li class="tutorial">Once approved, prints may take anywhere from a few hours to a week to be printed, depending on how busy the maker commons is. Keep in mind that the maker commons is generally busiest near the end of the semester, when many students need 3D models for final projects, and may restrict submissions to those required by a class.</li>
      <li class="tutorial">If you are at a commonwealth campus or are a World Campus student, expect an extra 3-5 days for your print to be shipped. If you are at University Park, go to the commons services desk on the first floor of the Pattee/Paterno Library to pick up your print. If you are at a commonwealth campus, pick up your print from your campuses library. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>IV. Finalizing Your Print</h2>
    <ol class="tutorial">
      <li class="tutorial">Once you receive your print, you may notice there is a lot of extra material attached to it. This is called support material, and is used to allow a 3D printer to print over what would otherwise be empty space. This support can be identified by often being very choppy and existing under areas of your model that would otherwise hang over empty space.</li>
      <li class="tutorial">To begin removing support, first remove the solid layer of material on the bottom. This is called the raft, and helps keep the model securely on the bed while printing and can easily be removed by hand.</li>
      <li class="tutorial">For removing the rest of the support, while some can be removed by hand, it is advised to use tools to assist you. Tools such as a flathead screwdriver or needlenose plyers generally work very well for removing support in small or tough to reach areas.</li>
      <ul class="tutorial">
        <li class="tutorial">Be very careful not to break off other parts of the model while removing support, or you may have to start over and reprint the entire model! </li>
      </ul>
      <li class="tutorial">If you need visual assistance while removing support, it may be a good idea to download and open the .stl file located on the same page as the .makerbot files in order to view what your final model should look like and give you a visual reference. </li>
      <li class="tutorial">Once the support is removed, you will now have your final print!</li>
