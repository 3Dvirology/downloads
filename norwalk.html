  <p>Summary taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus">Wikipedia: Norovirus</a></p>
  <p>Norovirus, sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting bug, is the most common cause of gastroenteritis. Infection is characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Blood is not usually present. Fever or headaches may also occur. This usually develops 12 to 48 hours after being exposed. Recovery typically occurs within 1 to 3 days. Complications may include dehydration.</p>
  <p>The virus is usually spread by the fecalâ€“oral route. This may be by contaminated food or water or person-to-person contact. It may also spread via contaminated surfaces or through the air. Risk factors include unsanitary food preparation. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms. Confirmatory testing may be done for public health purposes.</p>
  <p>Prevention involves proper hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are less effective. A vaccine does not exist. There is no specific treatment. Efforts involve supportive care such as drinking sufficient fluids or intravenous fluids. Oral rehydration solutions are the preferred fluids to drink.</p>
  <p>Norovirus results in about 685 million cases of disease and 200,000 deaths globally a year. It is common both in the developed and developing world. Those under the age of five are most often affected and in this group it results in about 50,000 deaths in the developing world. Disease more commonly occurs in winter months. It often occurs in outbreaks, especially among those living in close quarters. In the United States it is the cause of about half of food-borne disease outbreaks. The disease is named after Norwalk, Ohio, where an outbreak occurred in 1968.</p>
